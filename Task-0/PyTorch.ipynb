Barebones PyTorch\n\nPyTorch ships with high-level APIs to help us define model architectures conveniently, which we will cover in Part II of this tutorial. In this section, we will start with the barebone PyTorch elements to understand the autograd engine better. After this exercise, you will come to appreciate the high-level model API more.\n\nWe will start with a simple fully-connected ReLU network with two hidden layers and no biases for CIFAR classification. \nThis implementation computes the forward pass using operations on PyTorch Tensors, and uses PyTorch autograd to compute gradients. It is important that you understand every line, because you will write a harder version after the example.\n\nWhen we create a PyTorch Tensor with `requires_grad=True`, then operations involving that Tensor will not just compute values; they will also build up a computational graph in the background, allowing us to easily backpropagate through the graph to compute gradients of some Tensors with respect to a downstream loss. Concretely if x is a Tensor with `x.requires_grad == True` then after backpropagation `x.grad` will be another Tensor holding the gradient of x with respect to the scalar loss at the end."},{"metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"8RQj-Dsw7Uia"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### PyTorch Tensors: Flatten Function (10 points)\nA PyTorch Tensor is conceptionally similar to a numpy array: it is an n-dimensional grid of numbers, and like numpy PyTorch provides many functions to efficiently operate on Tensors. As a simple example, we provide a `flatten` function below which reshapes image data for use in a fully-connected neural network.\n\nRecall that image data is typically stored in a Tensor of shape N x C x H x W, where:\n\n* N is the number of datapoints\n* C is the number of channels\n* H is the height of the intermediate feature map in pixels\n* W is the height of the intermediate feature map in pixels\n\nThis is the right way to represent the data when we are doing something like a 2D convolution, that needs spatial understanding of where the intermediate features are relative to each other. When we use fully connected affine layers to process the image, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data. So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `C x H x W` values per representation into a single long vector. The flatten function below first reads in the N, C, H, and W values from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be C x H x W, but we don't need to specify that explicitly).

PyTorch Module API\n\nBarebone PyTorch requires that we track all the parameter tensors by hand. This is fine for small networks with a few tensors, but it would be extremely inconvenient and error-prone to track tens or hundreds of tensors in larger networks.\n\nPyTorch provides the `nn.Module` API for you to define arbitrary network architectures, while tracking every learnable parameters for you. In Part II, we implemented SGD ourselves. PyTorch also provides the `torch.optim` package that implements all the common optimizers, such as RMSProp, Adagrad, and Adam. It even supports approximate second-order methods like L-BFGS! You can refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html) for the exact specifications of each optimizer.\n\nTo use the Module API, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Subclass `nn.Module`. Give your network class an intuitive name like `TwoLayerFC`. \n\n2. In the constructor `__init__()`, define all the layers you need as class attributes. Layer objects like `nn.Linear` are themselves `nn.Module` subclasses and contain learnable parameters, so that you don't have to instantiate the raw tensors yourself. `nn.Module` will track these internal parameters for you. Refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html) to learn more about the dozens of builtin layers. **Warning**: don't forget to call the `super().__init__()` first!\n\n3. In the `forward()` method, define the *connectivity* of your network. You should use the attributes defined in `__init__` as function calls that take tensor as input and output the \"transformed\" tensor. Do *not* create any new layers with learnable parameters in `forward()`! All of them must be declared upfront in `__init__`. \n\nAfter you define your Module subclass, you can instantiate it as an object and call it just like the NN forward function in part II.\n\n**Tip:** Dense, Linear and fully connected (fc) layers are synonims and mean the same thing.\n\n**Tip 2:** Do **not** apply nonlinearity after the last layer of the network.\n\n### Module API: Two-Layer Network (20 points)\nHere is a concrete example of a 2-layer fully connected network:"},{"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"colab_type":"code","executionInfo":{"elapsed":579,"status":"ok","timestamp":1549437589631,"user":{"displayName":"Alexey Sorokin","photoUrl":"","userId":"16189107033522981450"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"K4l-pdw37Uit","outputId":"c1b5aa11-fdd9-40c1-e85b-10005fe48a3a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"class TwoLayerFC(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):\n        super().__init__()\n        ########################################################################\n        # TODO: Assign layer objects to class attributes.
