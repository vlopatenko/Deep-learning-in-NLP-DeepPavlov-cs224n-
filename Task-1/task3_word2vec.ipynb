    "# Assignment 1.3: Naive word2vec (40 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "This task can be formulated very simply. Follow this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2738.pdf) and implement word2vec like a two-layer neural network with matrices $W$ and $W'$. One matrix projects words to low-dimensional 'hidden' space and the other - back to high-dimensional vocabulary space.\n",
    "\n",
    "![word2vec](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6eVXZ.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use TensorFlow/PyTorch and code from your previous task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results of this task: (30 points)\n",
    " * trained word vectors (mention somewhere, how long it took to train)\n",
    " * plotted loss (so we can see that it has converged)\n",
    " * function to map token to corresponding word vector\n",
    " * beautiful visualizations (PCE, T-SNE), you can use TensorBoard and play with your vectors in 3D (don't forget to add screenshots to the task)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extra questions: (10 points)\n",
    " * Intrinsic evaluation: you can find datasets [here](http://download.tensorflow.org/data/questions-words.txt)\n",
    " * Extrinsic evaluation: you can use [these](https://medium.com/@dataturks/rare-text-classification-open-datasets-9d340c8c508e)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you can find any other datasets for quantitative evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again. It is **highly recommended** to read this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2738.pdf)\n",
